# TypeScript Calculator

A calculator inspired by the 1987 Dieter Rams-designed Braun ET66. Built in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

[See it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/typescript-calculator-cu45o)

### Features

- React hooks for Redux-style state management (combination of `useReducer` and `createContext`)
- Theming with [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#typescript)
- Full memory operations

### Resources

- The Braun ET66 calculator and [several articles](https://www.counter-print.co.uk/blogs/spotlight-on-design/spotlight-on-design-braun-calculator) about its history and design by Dieter Rams. [This manual](https://www.braun-clocks.com/skin/frontend/ultimo/default/pdf/BRAUN_BNE001_Calculator.pdf) for a similar Braun calculator was also helpful.
- A talk on TypeScript (video to come) by [Charles Peters](https://charlespeters.net/) I heard at a [SeattleReactJS](https://seattlereactjs.dev/) meetup. I went off of Charles' ["Strongly Typed Reducer"](https://codesandbox.io/embed/ppy26kyxzq?codemirror=1) example for state management.
- [This tutorial](https://freshman.tech/calculator/) was helpful in coding some of the calculator logic. Looked at a lot of these, and this was one of the most straightforward.
